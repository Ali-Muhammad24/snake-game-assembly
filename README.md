# Snake Game in x86 Assembly Language

A classic **Snake Game** implemented entirely in **x86 Assembly Language** using BIOS and DOS interrupts.  
This project was developed as a **pair project during my 4th semester** to strengthen low-level programming concepts and understanding of hardware-level operations.

## Project Type
**Academic Pair Project**

Developed collaboratively with a teammate as part of university coursework.

## Features
- Fully functional Snake gameplay in text mode
- Queue-based implementation of snake body (without high-level libraries)
- Real-time keyboard input using BIOS interrupts
- Direct manipulation of video memory (0xB800)
- Score and lives tracking system
- Wall and self-collision detection
- Pseudo-random food generation
- Game restart and exit functionality
